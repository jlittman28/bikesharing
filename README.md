# bikesharing

## Overview
Presenting data in a convincing matter is key expanding a business in a new market. We were tasked with building a business proposal, using data in NYC to present a story Tableau to investors to expand bike-sharing into Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

### August Peak Hours
Peak bike usage hours are at 7:00-9:00AM and 5:00-6:00PM (commuting hours). These are commuting hours. Citibike should properly staff employees around this time to help restock popular docks around the city and resolve any issues remotely.
